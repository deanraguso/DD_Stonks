## Description
In response to a brief 2 day Hackathon, Dean and Deeon embark on the worlds most technically ambitious project. Creating a Rails application that connections with... the Runescape Grand Exchange.

The Grand Exchange is like a stock market, with daily item price fluctuations, which some players track in order to make in-game currency, it's quite a viable strategy if you have enough gold to start with.

This application acts like a stock watch-list, is easy to use, and could help keep track of investments.

## Features 
- User management system, with authentication using Devise.
- Access to the Runescape API with a clean search bar and categories.
- Ability to favorite items on the Grand Exchange, authorized by the current user.
